	<h1>Outcome5</h1>
	<h2>MRV capacity to implement REDD+ strengthened</h2>
	<p>
	According to the <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_UN-REDD_Programme_document_2009.pdf">Zambia UN-REDD Programme document</a> this outcome was designed to use existing methodologies to establish an effective MRV System for REDD+. The expected outputs were as follows:
	</p>
	<h3>Output 5.1: REDD+ integrated with forestry inventory system (ILUA).</h3>
	<p>
	This output was designed to assess the ILUA II inventory system in terms of its compatibility with REDD+ MRV requirements, and make appropriate refinements to the inventory system. Specifically, ILUA II data collection will be evaluated in terms of possibilities for use in greenhouse gas inventory calculations. Clear collaboration was envisaged with the ILUA II programme, in order to be able to strengthen joint work and data sharing opportunities.
	</p>
	<h3>Output 5.2: Operational Forest Monitoring System established and institutionalized.</h3>
	<p>
	This output was designed to ensure the longevity of the REDD+ MRV System, and ensure that regional approaches and outcomes can be compared. It also ensures that the REDD+ methodologies adopted will be current and applicable to Zambian systems. Further, it would satisfy requirements under the Cancun Agreements (Decision 1/CP.16) that countries develop a “robust and transparent national forest monitoring system for the monitoring and reporting REDD+ activities”.
	</p>
	<h3>Output 5.3: Greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forest lands estimated and reported.</h3>
	<p>
	This output will collate and analyse the greenhouse gas emissions data produced from the REDD+ MRV System. A training course is foreseen to increase local capacity and to explain the methodology for the GHG inventory and monitoring, as well as an in-depth explanation of the IPCC Guidelines. 
	</p>
	<h2>Progress</h2>
	<h3>Output 5.1: REDD+ integrated with forestry inventory system (ILUA).</h3>
	<p>
	For a credible MRV system, the UN-REDD program in Zambia requires measurements on carbon pools as identified by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) such as aboveground biomass, coarse woody debris, fine litter, and soil organic carbon. Information on these carbon pools for different forest types subject to different degrees of deforestation, degradation and different land uses is a critical input into Zambia’s carbon stock calculations and the ability to report greenhouse gas emission reductions as a precursor to performance based payments under REDD+. With activities under Output 5.1, the design of ILUA II has been modified for UN-REDD MRV information needs. Forest carbon stock measurements for above-ground, litter, course woody debris, and soil organic carbon have been included in ILUA II field measurements. The sampling design and field methodology (see <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/ZM_Biophysical_Field_Manual_15July2013.pdf">ZM Biophysical Field Manual 15 July 2013</a>) is applied to more than 4,000 sampling sites representing different forest types subject to different degrees of deforestation, degradation and different land uses across Zambia. This integration is also described in <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/ILUAII_UNREDD_Zambia.pdf">this document</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	An important technical input from the UN-REDD programme under Output 5.1 has been the development of methodology for the collection of data on Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), and integrating this methodology into ILUA II. This has been achieved (see <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/ZM_Biophysical_Field_Manual_15July2013.pdf">ZM Biophysical Field Manual 15 July 2013</a>) along with the development of laboratory protocols for determination of SOC. The UN-REDD program subsequently equipped the Soils Analysis Laboratory at Zambia Forestry Research in Kitwe for SOC analysis. As of mid-year 2013, SOC laboratory analysis has been completed for north-western province, and the data is currently being analysed to provide the first nationally consistent analysis of soil carbon stocks in Zambia.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first results for ILUA II in north-western province are now available, and demonstrate the benefits of integration under Output 5.1 with detailed provincial level data on forest carbon pools for different forest types, land uses, and canopy cover. 
	</p>
	<h3>Output 5.2: Operational Forest Monitoring System established and institutionalized.</h3>
	<p>
	Zambia’s work in the area of Measuring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) for REDD+ has focused on the development of a decentralized national forest monitoring system (NFMS). This has required extensive in-country capacity building and infrastructure development. With support from the UN-REDD Programme, ten provincial NFMS laboratories have been established and equipped with tools for forest monitoring, including computers with Geographic Information System (GIS) software, Geographical Positioning System (GPS) units for forest monitoring field activities, and printers and plotters for field map production. Each provincial NFMS laboratory is staffed by a group of trained cross-sectoral technicians from the forestry, agriculture and planning sectors who provide a decentralized hub of MRV expertise. The laboratories provide near real-time spatial data on deforestation and forest degradation that can be relayed to the central national forest monitoring laboratory in Lusaka to inform national reporting. The development of the national forest monitoring system for Zambia was published by the UN-REDD Secretariat as a <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_NFMS_EN_FINAL.pdf">UN-REDD success story</a>. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Extensive infrastructure development and capacity building has been achieved under Output 5.2. Initially, 10 provincial teams were constituted consisting of cross-sectoral technicians from the forestry, agriculture and planning sectors. The technicians were trained in the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) at an intensive training conducted at the national remote sensing centre (NRSC) in Zambia. The training manual can be observed here (Link to training manual). Following the training, the infrastructure was procured and the 10 NFMS laboratories were established. <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_NFMS_Provincial_GIS_Training_Report_NRSC_2012.pdf">This report</a> details the deployment of equipment to the 10 provincial NFMS offices and follow up training at each office in GIS also provided by NRSC. During infrastructure deployment and follow-up GIS training a complete GIS dataset for Zambia was provided to each office. The NFMS offices and cross-sectoral teams will be engaged in field-based forest monitoring activities; hence training in the use of Global Positioning Systems (GPS) was required. <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_NFMS_Provincial_GPS_Training_Report_NRSC_2013.pdf">This report</a> details the deployment of GPS units and training in GPS provided by NRSC to provincial NFMS offices. In 2013 a NFMS laboratory was established at Forestry Department Headquarters (FD HQ) in Lusaka. The FD HQ laboratory is the coordinating NFMS office where all GIS data on deforestation and forest degradation from provincial NFMS offices is sent.
	</p>
	<p>
	During 2013, an independent capacity assessment of the 10 provincial NFMS laboratories was commissioned by UN-REDD to understand the status of infrastructure and capacity at the 10 offices. The independent report can be found <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_NFMS_GIS_GPS_Capacity_Assessment_Report_2013.pdf">here</a>. Further enhancements to Zambia’s NFMS are envisaged such as establishing a letter of agreement with each office for funding field forest monitoring activities, and stream-lining the exchange of GIS information on deforestation and degradation between provincial NFMS laboratories and the central NFMS laboratory at FD HQ in Lusaka.
	</p>
	<p>
	Similar to other developing countries, there are many national, regional, and international initiatives having interventions in the forests sector in Zambia. It is important that the efforts of these initiatives and interventions are coordinated. As much possible, work on MRV under the UN-REDD programme in Zambia coordinates and collaborates with the following initiatives:

	<h3>Output 5.3: Greenhouse gas emissions and removals from forest lands estimated and reported.</h3>
	<p>
	Work under output 5.3 has focused on capacity building in GHG inventory and Allometric Equations and the compilation of greenhouse gas emissions data for Zambia.
	</p>
	<p>
	During 2012 a <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Training_Manual_GHG_and_MRV_Zambia_UN-REDD_2012.pdf">training manual for capacity building in GHG inventory</a> was developed specifically for Zambian conditions. Based on this training manual a comprehensive training course in GHG inventory, IPCC guidelines, and MRV reporting was delivered to provincial cross-sectoral technicians from NFMS offices as well Lusaka based technicians. The workshop report can be found here (link to “UNREDD FAO MRV GHG Training Workshop Report 2012”).
	</p>
	<p>
	Allometric Equations (AEs) are used for converting field measurements (such as taken in ILUA I and ILUA II) into estimates of biomass, carbon and timber volume and are poorly elaborated for the forest types of Zambia. Accurate estimates of biomass and carbon will be fundamental to MRV reporting, hence a workshop was conducted firstly to build capacity in stakeholder understanding of AEs and secondly to develop a roadmap for improving AEs for Zambia. The workshop report can be found <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/UNREDD_FAO_Allometric_Equations_Training_Workshop_Report_2012.pdf">here</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	To facilitate the compilation of greenhouse gas emissions data for Zambia, a study was commissioned in 2012 to develop an “IPCC compliant GHG reporting methodology for Forest Lands in Zambia”. The study compiled existing Emission Factors for Zambia, identified where further work on Emission Factors was required for MRV for REDD+, and developed a GHG reporting methodology that could be applied by the mandated institution. The study has been validated and is in the final stages of publication.
