	<h1>Outcome6</h1>
	<h2>Assessment of Reference Emission Level (REL) and Reference Level (RL) undertaken</h2>
	<p>
	According to the <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_UN-REDD_Programme_document_2009.pdf">Zambia UN-REDD Programme document</a> the objective of this outcome was to support Zambia in its ability to report on emission reductions through REDD+ related activities. The expected outputs were as follows:
	</p>
	<h3>Output 6.1: Historical rates of forest area and carbon stock changes reviewed.</h3>
	<p>
	This component had two main outcomes, namely the definition of RELs and RLs for Zambia. 
	The specific proposed activities were:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assess historical forest area (changes) at the national level.</li>
		<li>Assess historical greenhouse gas emission and removal rates at the national level.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Output 6.2: National circumstances assessed.</h3>
	<p>
	The assessment of the different national circumstances is a key element for the application of the UNFCCC principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities” and it is the only factor (criteria) that has been used so far in the context of the UNFCCC to adjust human induced greenhouse gas related data.
	</p>
	<p>
	The definition of the Zambian national circumstances will be established in order to be used to adjust the historic data. The assessment of the Zambian national circumstances will be based on the analysis of the socio-economic data and on the analysis of future projections of Zambia development and on potential changes in forest land cover. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The specific proposed activities were:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assess the opportunity cost of land providing REDD+ benefits in relation to other land uses.</li>
		<li>Assess the national socio-economic conditions.</li>
		<li>Assess needs and resources for sustainable development.</li>
		<li>Review expected trends for forest area changes.</li>
		<li>Collect economic data on other sectors relevant to deforestation.</li>
		<li>Identify and map the most threatened forests.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Progress</h2>
	<h3>Output 6.1: Historical rates of forest area and carbon stock changes reviewed.</h3>
	<p>
	Historical rates of forest area change (Activity Data) need to be estimated as quantitative input to the construction of Reference Emission Levels (RELs). Hence, spatial land cover classification data is required for Zambia for several historical time periods. Collaborative work between the UN-REDD programme in Zambia and The Regional Centre for Mapping of Resources for Development (RCMRD) commenced in 2012 on IPCC compliant land cover classifications for the entirety of Zambia’s land mass for the years, 1990, 2000, and 2010. Land cover classifications for years 2000 and 2010 were completed at RCMRD collaboratively by Zambian and RCMRD remote sensing technicians. The UN-REDD programme in Zambia and the RCMRD collaboratively completed the field validation exercise late in 2012. The skills and methodology acquired by Zambian technicians allowed the team of technicians to complete a land cover classification for 1990 wholly within the Zambian Forestry Department. The actual classification scheme and methodological brief applied in the 1990 land cover classification can be viewed <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_1990_LCC_UN-REDD_2013.pdf">here</a>. The land cover classifications for 2000 and 2010 can be viewed on this portal. The land cover classification for 1990 is still being finalised, but will uploaded onto the portal when finished.
	</p>
	<p>
	To enhance the capacity of remote sensing technicians in Zambia, cross-sectoral technicians were also trained in the implementation of the Brazilian Forest Monitoring System (TerraAmazon) at the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) in Belem, Brazil during 2012.
	</p>
	<p>
	The estimation of historical greenhouse gas emissions and removal rates at the national level can be done by combining historical Activity Data from land cover classifications (described above) with the best available Emission Factors (carbon stock change) for each land cover change. To facilitate the compilation of Emission Factors for Zambia, a study was commissioned in 2012 to develop an “IPCC compliant GHG reporting methodology for Forest Lands in Zambia”. The study compiled existing Emission Factors for Zambia, identified where further work on Emission Factors was required for MRV for REDD+. The study has been validated and is in the final stages of publication.
	</p>
	<p>
	With quantitative elements of REL construction complete (historical Activity Data and Emission Factors), a high level discussion is required on the preferred approach to REL construction in Zambia. These discussions will commence late in 2013, with expert guidance on alternative approaches to REL construction.

	<h3>Output 6.2: National circumstances assessed.</h3>
	<p>
	To facilitate the assessment of National Circumstances in Zambia, a study was commissioned in 2012 to develop an “IPCC compliant GHG reporting methodology for Forest Lands in Zambia”. The study “Assessing the economic context of REDD+ in Zambia” included a detailed analysis of the opportunity cost of REDD+, a determination of economic data on sectors relevant to deforestation, national socio-economic conditions, and the needs and resources for sustainable development.
	The study has been validated and is in the final stages of publication.
	</p>
	<p>
	National Circumstances related to the expected trends for forest area changes, and the Identification and mapping of the most threatened forests were included in the study “Drivers of deforestation, identification of threatened forests and forest co-benefits other than carbon from REDD+ implementation in Zambia”. This study has produced estimates of forest area change, and has identified the most threatened forests in Zambia. The study has been validated and is in the final stages of publication.
	</p>
	<p>
	With quantitative elements of REL construction complete and National Circumstances identified, a high level discussion will commence late in 2013, with expert guidance on alternative approaches to REL construction.
