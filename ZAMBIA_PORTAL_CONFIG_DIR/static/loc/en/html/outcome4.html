	<h1>Outcome 4. National REDD+ strategies identified</h1>	
	<p>
	According to the <a target="_blank" href="static/pdf/Zambia_UN-REDD_Programme_document_2009.pdf">Zambia UN-REDD Programme document</a> Community-based REDD+ strategies need to be developed to counteract the drivers of deforestation. The envisaged outputs under Outcome 4 from the project document were as follows:
	</p>
	<p>
Output 4.1: Drivers of deforestation and forest degradation assessed. This output aimed to identify the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. 
	</p>
	<p>
Output 4.2: Candidate activities for REDD+ identified. This output aimed to identify appropriate activities for shifting forest resource use and thereby reducing deforestation and forest degradation. The suggested activities were: 
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
		Identify global best practices and benchmarking for forest management and REDD+ activities, and tailor practices to Zambian conditions to ensure the identification of suitable activities.
		</li>
		<li>
		Identify and map multiple benefits of REDD+ implementation.
		</li>
		<li>
		Identify evidence-based alternative livelihood options under REDD+.
		</li>
		<li>
		Consult experts on the development of a framework addressing opportunity costs for key stakeholders as well as cost abatement curves and follow up actions.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Progress</h2>
	<p>
	A number of assessments, data collections and analytical works have been completed under Outcome 4; they will provide the basis to identify the REDD+ strategic options during 2013.
	</p>
	<p>
	Analytical works under Output 4.1 and 4.2 were completed during 2012;

	<p>
	During 2013 further analytical works have been launched and are close to completion;
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
		Drivers of deforestation, identification of threatened forests and forest co-benefits other than carbon from REDD+ implementation in Zambia. This study has produced a detailed and spatially-explicit analysis of drivers of deforestation and degradation. It also Identified and mapped the multiple benefits of REDD+ implementation.
		</li>
		<li>			
		The Economic Context of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+) in Zambia. This study Identified evidence-based alternative livelihood options under REDD+, and also developed a framework addressing opportunity costs associated with the drivers of deforestation.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	With the completion of analytical work in 2013 associated with a detailed study of drivers of deforestation and the economics (opportunity cost) of REDD+ and envisaged work under Outcome 4 will have been completed with the identification of National REDD+ strategic options.
